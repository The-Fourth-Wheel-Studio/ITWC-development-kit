# ITWC development kit
well well well, i'm a good developer that for sure (no i'm not), anyway if even myself can't read some of my script you can't ! (i mean yes you can but it's complicated.)
And because i'm a crazy man with a crazy brain, my code is absolute garbadge ! so i will explain **every single itty bitty line of code** right here so everyone can understand and build magnificent thing with my tools ! 

i will mostly explain fundamental things like the structure of some node and what do you have to put in all the @export variable (i love @export you will see).

So have fun decrypting all of my intricated and spagettied script and good luck! (and sorry for the bad spelling i'm a frogeater so i don't know english very well)
